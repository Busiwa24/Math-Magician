    Did you know that nature loves Fibonacci sequences? The spiral shapes of sunflowers and other patterns in nature follow a Fibonacci sequence, 
    where adding the two preceding numbers in the sequence gives you the next (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.)
    And If you multiply 111,111,111 Ã— 111,111,111 you get 12,345,678,987,654,321 - a palindrome number that reads the same forwards or backwards.
    And that works all the way back down to 11 x 11 (121) or just 1 x 1 (1).
    In a crowded room probably two people share a birthday.It only takes 23 people to enter a room to give you an evens chance that two of them have the same birthday.
   With 75 people in the room the chances rise to 99 per cent!
